title: A Look into Rust with Cellular Automata
---
**Nowadays**, I'm trying to learn **Rust**, a programmming language. I kept hearing the name Rust a lot in the past and read some articles here and there but never got interested. This post will be a documentation to keep track of what I've learnt so far. I will also write about [**cellular automata**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) because it is fun to implement and it requires you to use basic structures of the language.
