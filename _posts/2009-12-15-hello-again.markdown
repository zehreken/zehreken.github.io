title: Hello Again!
---
**I** have started a blog here about my researches and experiments on object oriented programming. Iâ€™m going to use **actionscript 3.0** to create web-friendly applications and I especially want to deal with game artificial intelligence and physics. I hope we all have a good time.

Take care till the next post.
