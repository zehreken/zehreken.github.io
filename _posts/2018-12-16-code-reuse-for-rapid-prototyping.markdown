title: Code Reuse for Rapid Prototyping
---
**Hyper casual games** are today's hottest topic in mobile game development.
First of all what is an hyper casual game? An hyper casual game is a super simple, easy to play and hard to master, instant play game.

To be successful in the hyper casual game market, you need to be fast at prototyping and creating the minimum viable product. In this post, I will not talk about the design process of MVPs but programming and technical aspects.
The fastest way to create an MVP is writing less code obviously, and to write less code you need to reuse the ones you have already written.

#### Code Reuse
In the software industry everybody, especially managers love the term _code reuse_. But it is always hard to reuse the code, no programmer wants to use others' code since she needs to understand what the code is doing first. And probably she finds it easier to write it from scratch.
So to promote code reuse, you need to write reusable code. How is this possible?
