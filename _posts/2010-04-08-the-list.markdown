title: The List
---
Hello everyone, I’ve decided to make a list of programs that I use, some of them are free and some of them are also open source. The main purpose of this list is to have a “programs to install” list after formatting but I thought everyone needs a list like this so I’m writing it. By the way, I plan to update this post often.

FastStone Image Viewer (Free): The best image viewer I’ve ever used. I’m using it for 5-6 years and I never needed another image viewer.
FastStone Photo Resizer (Free): I use this to resize a bunch of images with one click. I think it has some other features but that’s enough for me.
Pidgin Universal Chat Client (Free): Pidgin is an instant messaging software that supports multiple chat networks like MSN, Google Talk, Yahoo and more at the same time. It really has a simple interface and lots of options and plug-ins to personalize.
