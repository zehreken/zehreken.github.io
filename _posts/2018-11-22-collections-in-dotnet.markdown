title: Collections in .NET
---
Yesterday, I was surfing on msdn and reading .NET documentation and when hit the topic _collections_ I was surprised that there are some generic collection types I have never heard of. I was also ashamed to be honest. It has been 5 years since I started using C# professionally and I have never used their LinkedList and Stack implementations. Whenever I needed a LinkedList I wrote my own, which is fun or whenever I needed a Stack, I used List as a stack.
In this post I want to try them one by one, come up with use cases and test their performance.
Last month, I was trying to decide on what data structure to use for a hexagonal grid. I checked .Net's documentation and surprised that there are a lot of different collections, for a really diverse case of uses. I'm familiar with some of them but not familiar with the rest.

#### Dictionary
#### HashSet
#### LinkedList
#### List
#### Queue
#### Stack
