title: Collections in .NET
---

Last month, I was trying to decide on what data structure to use for a hexagonal grid. I checked .Net's documentation and surprised that there are a lot of different collections, for a really diverse case of uses. I'm familiar with some of them but not familiar with the rest.

Dictionary
HashSet
LinkedList
List
Queue
Stack
