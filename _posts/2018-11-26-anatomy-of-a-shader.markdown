title: Anatomy of a Shader
---
Shaders are always a popular topic in game development. Obviously, you need nice and fast shaders if you want your game to look nice and to play fast. I tried to learn shaders several times but didn't succeed a lot honestly. I can read shaders and sometimes modify them, I can also write very simple but not useful shaders but it is not enough. I want to learn more and I want to blog about it to progress faster. Hopefully these posts will help others as well.
