title: Cache Miss and Data Locality
---
**Programmers** working in the game industry are proud people, even the gameplay programmers like me. And the good ones are right about it. It is a hard job. We care about performance, we want our code to be fast, sometimes more than necessary. But we usually look for the problem in the wrong place, we try to optimize our code by using faster algorithms but never check or care about where we put our data.

In the past years, the increase in CPU speed compared to Memory speed is enormous. As good as it sounds, it is actually a bad thing. In the past, CPU speed and Memory speed were close and they worked in harmony. But today, because of the speed difference, CPU waits for the Memory and wastes our precious cycles on doing nothing. This is called a cache miss. Whenever the CPU wants some piece of data and can't find it, it is a cache miss. And it looks to a higher level cache, if it can't find it there it is another cache miss and it looks to a higher level cache and so on till it can find it.

## Why
The reason for cache misses is bad data locality. When the CPU request data
