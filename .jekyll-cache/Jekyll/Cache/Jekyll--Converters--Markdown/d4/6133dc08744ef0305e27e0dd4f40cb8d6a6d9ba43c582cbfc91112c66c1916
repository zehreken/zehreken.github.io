I"k<p><strong>Dealing</strong> with strings is always a hassle. Since they are immutable, procedures with strings are slow and memory heavy. For the last two months I have been working on a word game for mobile devices. As you know, we programmers are responsible for the performance of our games on mobile platforms because of limited resources on the devices.</p>
