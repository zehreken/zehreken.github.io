I"!<p><strong>Several</strong> months ago I’ve enrolled in one of Coursera’s awesome classes, <strong>Algorithms: Design and Analysis</strong> from <strong>Tim Roughgarden</strong>. I think, most of you know about these online classes from <strong>Coursera</strong> and <strong>Udacity</strong>, if you don’t, I strongly advise you to take a look. I’m sure you will find a class that suits you. Anyway, this class was my third online class and I didn’t manage to finish any of them yet, nevertheless I’ve learned so much from them.</p>
