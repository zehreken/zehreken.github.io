I"T<p><strong>Nowadays</strong>, I’m trying to learn <strong>Rust</strong>, a programmming language. I kept hearing the name Rust a lot in the past and read some articles here and there but never got interested. This post will be a documentation to keep track of what I’ve learnt so far. I will also write about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton"><strong>cellular automata</strong></a> because it is fun to implement and it requires you to use basic structures of the language.</p>
