I"c<p><strong>I</strong> have started a blog here about my researches and experiments on object oriented programming. Iâ€™m going to use <strong>actionscript 3.0</strong> to create web-friendly applications and I especially want to deal with game artificial intelligence and physics. I hope we all have a good time.</p>

<p>Take care till the next post.</p>
