        Hello, I'm Güçhan. I'm a game programmer with 16 years of experience. I've worked on PC, console and mobile
        games. I'm a very curious person by nature. I like thinking in first principles, breaking things down to simpler
        parts and build again.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think I'm a great fit for this position on either intermediate or senior level. Given the opportunity I would
        gladly step up to help building the team and leading afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here you are, listening to my cloned voice using Speecht5 model. I thought it would be a fun idea to send my
        cover letter for this position in audio format using my cloned voice but I didn't realize how time consuming it
        would be even to achieve this horrible cloned voice.
    </p>
    <p>
        Best regards,<br>
        Güçhan Alkan
