        Hello, I'm Güçhan. I'm a game programmer with 16 years of experience. I've worked on PC, console, and mobile
        games.<br>I'm naturally curious and like to approach things from first principles, breaking them down and
        building them up
        again.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe I'm a strong fit for this position at Fatshark. Given the opportunity,<br>I would gladly help build
        the
        team and take
        on leadership responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        You're now listening to my cloned voice, generated with the SpeechT5 model.<br>I thought it would be fun to send
        my cover letter in audio format using my own cloned voice.<br>It turned out to be more time-consuming than I
        expected, and the result still sounds pretty bad.<br>But I learned a
        lot in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Best regards,<br>
        Güçhan Alkan
    </p>
