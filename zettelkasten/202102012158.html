<h1>Gut Microbiome</h1>
<p><strong>All disease begins in the gut</strong> -Socrates</p>
<p>Antibiotics, stress, processed foods are all bad for gut microbiome, these can cause the imbalance
of good and bad bacteria and even completely destroy some types of the bacteria. If a type of
bacteria is completely destroyed, it is really hard, if not impossible, to restore it. Food for
good bacteria is called prebiotics, this is generally hard to digest plant fiber. Good bacteria
feeds on this fiber. And probiotics is foods with bacteria in it. Fermented foods like sauerkraut,
kimchi, yoghurt and kefir are good examples.</p>
<p>Some important good bacterias are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bifidobacterium</li>
<li>Lactobacillus (yoghurt)</li>
<li>Lactococcus</li>
<li>Saccharomyces</li>
</ul>
