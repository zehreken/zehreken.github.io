    <h1>[DRAFT] Derivative</h1>
    <small>#maths</small>
    <p>The <em>derivative</em> of f at the point x is</p>
<p>lim(f(x+h) - f(x)) / h where lim(h-&gt;0) or</p>
<p>lim(f(w) - f(x)) / (w - x) where w-&gt;x.</p>
<p>If this limit exists, then we can say that f is differentiable at point x and
the derivative is shown as <em>f'(x)(f-prime)</em> or <em>d/dx f(x)</em>. The derivative is a
ratio.</p>
<p>There is also the power rule which makes it easier to calculate derivatives.</p>
<p>d/dx xn = n*x^(n-1)</p>
<p>The sign of the derivative records how the output of the function is related to
the change in the input. If the derivative is positive then if the input x
increases f(x) also increases and if the derivative is negative then if the
input x increases f(x) decreases. I think this is some type of correlation.</p>
