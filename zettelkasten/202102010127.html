<small>#health</small>
<p>Mitochondria is an organelle found in human and other animal cells that basically produce energy in the form of ATP. Having low quality mitochondria is related to aging. Or aging seems to damage the mitochondria. Cutting off sugar, taking cold showers and high intensity exercises improve the average mitochondria health in the body by killing the weak mitochondria.</p>
