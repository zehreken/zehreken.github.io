<h1>[DRAFT] Game design</h1>
<small>#game-design #loss-aversion</small>
<p>Something I've realised while playing 'Into the Breach' is that even though grid power and mission task star are almost equal, it feels like mission task stars are more valuable. You can buy 1 grid power buy spending 1 star but you can also buy other things for task stars. So task stars are slightly more valuable.</p>
<p>For example, if you lose 2 grid power to gain 1 task star it is a bad decision, but it gives the sense of accomplishment to gain task stars. This is interesting twist in loss aversion because in this case something you are going to gain feels more valuable than something you already have even though they are almost equal.</p>
