<h1>Attitude towards Money</h1>
<small>#money #investing</small>
<p>I never like it when someone, let it be a friend or a lover, says, &quot;I can't do it&quot;. For me, it should be &quot;how can I do it?&quot;. In Rich Dad, Poor Dad, the author's attitude towards money is similar. Instead of saying &quot;I can't afford it&quot;, ask &quot;how can I afford it?&quot;.
Of course always keep in mind that unnecessary consumption is bad.</p>
