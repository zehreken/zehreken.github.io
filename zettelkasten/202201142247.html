<h1>[DRAFT] Why You Should Never Have a Fracture</h1>
<small>#health #life-experience</small>
<p>This is a warning for my future self and also for others who like train hard or do extreme physical activities.
I'm not a person to tell you to stop doing those activities. On the contrary, I want me and you to be physically
active as long as possible. So be really careful, take every precaution you can and enjoy.</p>
<p>I fractured my left thumb on December 29th at the gym while trying to do a handstand using the pushup bars.
The bar on the left slipped backwards, I fell on my face and broke my glasses along with my left thumb.
I went to emergency, images taken and I learnt that I have a Bennett's Fracture.</p>
<p>Now, I don't want to discuss the pain, the healing process and the possible complications of a fracture.
I don't even want to discuss the possibility of developing post traumatic osteoarthritis which can be disabling at a young age.
These are really scary things.</p>
<p>What I want to discuss is the change a fracture can impose on your daily routines. Since I've fractured a thumb,
and the opposable thumb of the hand is one of the most distinct features of humans along with our big brains and ability to blush,
it had a profound effect on my life from day one.</p>
<p>Your self care routine will take a big hit. You will need to cover the cast with a rubbish bag.
It will be difficult to wash your hair, your face and the rest of your body with one hand.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to practice music with one hand.</p>
<p>Your hand will start to stink by the second week.</p>
<p>Obviously working out will be a hassle. Even the lightest yoga exercises will be difficult to do.
Your circulation will decline because of lacking exercise. You will lose muscle mass.</p>
<p>I was somehow lucky to have the cast for only 3 weeks but it was a really important lesson.</p>
