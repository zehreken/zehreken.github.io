    <h1>[DRAFT] Mathematics</h1>
    <small>#maths</small>
    <p>One of my realizations about Mathematics is that it is itself a toolbox and all of the features like
'function', 'limit' are tools that are invented to solve the problems and understand the universe
better. Previously I used to think that maths is a collection of rules emposed by nature but this is
incorrect. It is a human invention, our invention.</p>
