    <h1>[DRAFT] Occam's Razor</h1>
    <small>#science #skepticism</small>
    <p><em>Occam's Razor</em> suggests that if there are multiple explanations for the same phenomenon, the one that
has the least number of assumption should be chosen. Mistakenly, it is sometimes said that the simplest
should be chosen but it is wrong. Simple does not mean the least number of assumptions. For example
creationism is simpler than evolution but it assumes a creator which is a huge and unnecessary requirement.
Evolution, on the other hand, explains the varity of life on earth easily without the assumption of
a creator.</p>
<p>In another way Occam's razor ignores the parts of a theory which can not be observed. If you can observe
a thing you can not measure and experiment with it.</p>
