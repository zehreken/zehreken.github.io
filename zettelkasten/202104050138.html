<h1>[DRAFT] Seborrhoeic Dermatitis</h1>
<small>#health #seborrhoeic-dermatitis</small>
<p>Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a condition of the skin. It is an auto-immune disease. It is mostly visible around the nose, the scalp, around and under eyebrows, around and under mustache, around chin. Regularly using just a simple face cream helps a lot hydrating the skin and reduces the symptoms. And diet has a very important role on the condition. High sugar foods affect it negatively.</p>
<p>Blepharitis is a condition of the eyelids. They become red and swollen. I remember being asked many times in the past years that why my eyelids are red and swollen.</p>
