    <h1>[DRAFT] Cognition in Early Life</h1>
    <small>#cognition</small>
    <p>Humans, in the very early stages of their lifes, have very high brain plasticity. It is very important
to be in an enriched environment(what is an enriched environment really? Is it tiktok?) because it
promotes growth of <strong>cerebral cortex</strong>. And a more massive cerebral cortex makes future learning easier.</p>
