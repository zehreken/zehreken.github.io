<h1>[DRAFT] Dopamine</h1>
<p>Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that makes the reward system work. Dopamine makes us want things like food, social connection, sex and also escape from things like pain, bad smell etc. If dopamine level is high, you like that thing and if dopamine level is low you dislike that thing. Morphone and cocaine highjacks the reward system and makes us release dopamine. That is how addiction starts. Porn is as addictive as morphine.</p>
